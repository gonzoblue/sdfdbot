# sdfdbot

This is a bot to dump the current call log from PulsePoint (originally the SDFD incident page) and parse the calls. 
Any new call it will tweet about, and any call "special" enough will get an email sent.

This is not official or affiliated with SDFD in any way.

Install required modules:
pip install python-twitter bs4
